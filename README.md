# Data Portraits

A few months ago, I became curious about the type of data that social media sites have on me. We are online all of the time, and our devices are constantly pushing out data about our personal lives. Some of these data points contain details that we would not share with those closest to us, yet we still surrender this data without thinking about it. This is a project designed to help people think critically about the implications of living in a world influenced by data.

Did you know that Facebook let’s users download their own data? I did just that, and began to analyze. It was an eerie experience, but it also inspired me to consider the possibility of making art with this data. After extracting a list of topics used by Facebook to figure out which ads to show me, I wrote a script that created a self portrait using them. I look at the result and wonder if this is how social media sites see me. 

After fine-tunning the process, I invited people to explore their Facebook data, hoping that they would let me use it to create portraits of them. This led to some interesting discussions in which people reflected on how accurately their data portrait describes them.

# Contributing
This is an ongoing project and your help in expanding it would be greatly appreciated. Here is how:
1. Download your facebook data by following [this guide](https://www.facebook.com/help/212802592074644)
    - Choose the JSON format under the "Format" field in the form that prepares your download.
    - You can download ALL your data but that will take a while to prepare. For the purposes of this project, we only need the “Ads and Businesses” data. You can specify which data you are interested in downloading by clicking on the checkboxes below the main form.
2. It will take a while for facebook to prepare your data. It will be available under the “Available Copies” tab under the “Download Your Information” menu once it is ready.
3. Download the data and unzip the contents. 
4. Inside the unzipped folder, go to the “ads_and_businesses” folder, and find the ads_interests.json file. This file contains the topics that facebook thinks you are interested in (for the purpose of serving ads). 
5. Now we need to find an image that you would like to use for the portrait. Just go through your photos and find one that describes you well.
6. Send the ads_interests.json and your image to juanborbon93@gmail.com. Please write “DATA PORTRAIT” in the subject line. 

That’s it! I’ll send you your data portrait within the week. If you have any questions about any part of this process, please shoot me an email.
